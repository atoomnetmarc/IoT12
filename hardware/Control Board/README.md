# Assembly instructions

Use the [interactive BOM](bom/ibom.html) to identify values and positions of the components.

Solder all small 0805 SMD resistors and capacitors.
Read special instructions for R60, R61 and R62, R63 in the schematic.

Measure all resistors and check if they are all the correct resistance.

Solder rest of SMD components.

Clean PCB.

Inspect PCB with microscope for shorted pins (in ICs). Correct when found.

Solder all through-hole components.

Clean PCB.

You now have something like this:

Apply current limited 5V to GND and +5V on J4. Almost no current should flow.

Apply current limited 3.3V to GND and 3V3 on J6. Almost no current should flow.

# Done

Done!
