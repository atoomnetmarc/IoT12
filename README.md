Hi!

This is an attempt at creating a soldering iron controller that uses T12 tips.

The name IoT12 is a portmanteau of IoT (because this soldering iron controller is connected to WiFi) and T12 (the type of soldering iron tip).

Have a look at the different elements that make up this project:

- [3d models for the case](3d/)
- [firmware for the heat controller and main processor](firmware/)
- [schematic and pcb](hardware/)
